## Grammar

### Expressing the Past

Expressing the past in Chinese is quite different from English. Instead of conjugating verbs like in English (e.g., "walk" becomes "walked"), Chinese relies on certain particles and time words to indicate past actions or experiences. Here are some common ways to express the past.

#### 1. **了** (le) – Indicating Completed Actions

- **了** is one of the most commonly used particles in Chinese to indicate that an action has been **completed**. It is often placed after the verb or at the end of the sentence to show that something **has happened** or **is finished**.
- It is not always strictly "past tense" but indicates that an action has been finalized.

##### Structure:
- Subject + Verb + **了** + Object
- Subject + Verb + Object + **了**

##### Examples:
- **我吃了饭。** *(Wǒ chī le fàn.)* – "I have eaten."
- **他昨天去北京了。** *(Tā zuótiān qù Běijīng le.)* – "He went to Beijing yesterday."

- You can use **了** to express specific, completed actions in the past, especially when paired with time words like **昨天** (zuótiān, yesterday) or **上周** (shàng zhōu, last week).

#### 2. **过** (guò) – Indicating Past Experiences

- **过** is used to indicate that someone **has experienced** or **done something** in the past at least once. It focuses on the fact that the action occurred before, rather than when it happened.
- **过** usually conveys the idea of "having experienced" something, similar to the English perfect tense ("I have been to...").

##### Structure:
- Subject + Verb + **过** + Object

##### Examples:
- **我去过北京。** *(Wǒ qùguò Běijīng.)* – "I have been to Beijing."
- **你吃过中国菜吗？** *(Nǐ chīguò Zhōngguó cài ma?)* – "Have you ever eaten Chinese food?"

- **过** emphasizes that an event or action happened at some point in the past, but the specific time is not important. It's about the **experience** of having done it.

#### 3. **Using Time Words to Indicate the Past**

In Chinese, it's common to use specific time words to indicate when something happened, especially when **了** or **过** are not needed. These words help clarify the time frame of the action.

##### Common Time Words:
- **昨天** (zuótiān) – Yesterday
- **去年** (qùnián) – Last year
- **刚才** (gāngcái) – Just now
- **以前** (yǐqián) – Before / In the past
- **上周** (shàng zhōu) – Last week
- **刚刚** (gānggāng) – Just recently

##### Examples:
- **我昨天去了公园。** *(Wǒ zuótiān qù le gōngyuán.)* – "I went to the park yesterday."
- **我们上周见过面了。** *(Wǒmen shàng zhōu jiànguò miàn le.)* – "We met last week."

#### 4. **不再** (bù zài) – Indicating that Something Happened in the Past and Won't Happen Again

To emphasize that something has happened and **will not happen again** in the future, you can use the expression **不再** (bù zài), meaning "no longer."

##### Example:
- **我不再抽烟了。** *(Wǒ bù zài chōuyān le.)* – "I no longer smoke."

#### 5. **Contextual Use of Past Tense Without 了 or 过**

Sometimes, context alone can indicate the past tense without needing **了** or **过**. In these cases, the past action is understood simply because of the use of time expressions or because it's implied in the conversation.

##### Examples:
- **我昨天去学校。** *(Wǒ zuótiān qù xuéxiào.)* – "I went to school yesterday." (No **了** or **过** needed because **昨天** clarifies that it's in the past.)
- **他去年学习了中文。** *(Tā qùnián xuéxí le zhōngwén.)* – "He studied Chinese last year."


#### 6. **Key Differences Between 过 and 了**


### In short:
- **了** is used for **completed actions** and marks that something has occurred or been done. Example: 我去北京了 to say "I've gone to Beijing" or "I went to Beijing" (emphasizing a completed action, usually with a specific time or context).
- **过** is used for **past experiences**, focusing on whether someone has experienced something. Example: 我去过北京 to say "I've been to Beijing before" (emphasizing the experience).
- **Time words** can also indicate past actions, and in some cases, they are enough to indicate the past without **了** or **过**. Example: 我昨天去北京


### In short:
- **了** is used for **completed actions** and indicates that something has occurred or been done.
  Example: **我去北京了** to say "I've gone to Beijing" or "I went to Beijing" (emphasizing a completed action, usually with a specific time or context).

- **过** is used for **past experiences**, focusing on whether someone has experienced something.
  Example: **我去过北京** to say "I've been to Beijing before" (emphasizing the experience, not the specific time).

- **Time words** can also indicate past actions, and in some cases, they are enough to indicate the past without using **了** or **过**.
  Example: **我昨天去北京** means "I went to Beijing yesterday" (the time word **昨天** indicates the past).
